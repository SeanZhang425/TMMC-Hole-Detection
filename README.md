## About the Project

For my team's submission for the TMMC Innovation Challenge, we developed a program that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to identify and precisely locate any holes in automotive components. Over 300 images were collected, processed, and labeled manually to train a convolutional neural network model.

### Built With

* Python
* OpenCV
* YOLOv8

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

None!

### Installing & Executing Program

It is recommended to run the program on Google Colab for the most consistent results.

* Upload all YOLOv8 files to Google Drive

* Mount Google Drive in Colab by running the following code:
  
  ```
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('content/drive')
  ```
  
* Run all code segments of the Colab notebook
